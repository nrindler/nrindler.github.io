I had the opportunity to present on "Communicating Results in R" at the weekly **[Python Saigon Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Thanh-Pho-Ho-Chi-Minh-Python-Meetup/)**, on Feb 25, 2017 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

We had a great discussion and shared data visualization tools and techniques.

Materials are available on **[my GitHub](https://github.com/nrindler/saigon-meetup)**, including a **[RPres slide deck](/post/meetup.html)** with links and resources for learning R and data visualization.
